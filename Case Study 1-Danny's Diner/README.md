## Background
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
Danny’s Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, like their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favourite.
Whether Danny should expand the existing customer loyalty program using insights from the data collected? 
Also, to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
There are three datasets for this case study:
- sales
- menu
- members
