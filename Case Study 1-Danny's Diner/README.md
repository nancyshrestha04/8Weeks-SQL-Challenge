## Background
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
Danny’s Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, like their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favourite.
Whether Danny should expand the existing customer loyalty program using insights from the data collected? 
Also, to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
There are three datasets for this case study:
- sales
- menu
- members

## Case Study Questions

1.	What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2.	How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3.	What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4.	What is the most popular item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5.	Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6.	Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7.	Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8.	What are the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9.	If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier — how many points would each customer have?
10.	In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi — how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
