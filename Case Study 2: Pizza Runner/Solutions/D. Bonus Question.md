# Bonus Question ðŸªœ

### If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?
````sql
INSERT INTO
pizza_names ("pizza_id","pizza_name")
VALUES
(3,'Supreme');
INSERT INTO
pizza_recipes ("pizza_id","toppings")
VALUES
(3,'1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12');
````
To see the result
````sql
SELECT	*
FROM	pizza_names as pn
			JOIN pizza_recipes as pr
			ON pn.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id;
````
